At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod/v2).
This implementation will be using the ![DragonRuby Game Tool Kit](https://dragonruby.org/), and hopefully help us learn something new.
## Roguelike 2024
By: _Kehvarl <Kehvarl@Kehvarl.com>_
This roguelike is going to follow the structure of The Complete Roguelike Tutorial using DragonRuby GTK instead of Python + LibTCOD.  We may be able to comvert this to a new tutorial when it's complete.
